Approach on building ML model for Loan delinquency problem statement

Steps Involved:

1. Import the relevant libraries
2. Import the train dataset from train file
3. Pre-process the data in the dataset loaded from the file using sns plots
4. Create Dependent and Independent Variables
5. Create Encode Function for Train dataset and apply for the necessary columns
6. Create DataFrames for both X and y variables
7. Scale the Dataset using Binarizer with threshold value as 0.5
8. Split the Dataset using train_test_split of scikit learn
9. Build a model using SVC Classifier with linear kernel and fit the train data considering X_train and y_train
10. Predict the Train set using X_test
11. Create the Confusion Matrix
12. Evaluate True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives
13. Calculate F1-Score
14. Calculate AUC
15. Calculate Classifer Score
16. Test the model using Test data after data pre-processing, encoding and Scaling
17. Use the predict method of Classifier build and publish the output
18. Concatenate the output with loan_id column and export the output into a .csv file (submission.csv)

Outcome:
submission.csv file gets created in the "Home" dir of Jupyter Notebook
